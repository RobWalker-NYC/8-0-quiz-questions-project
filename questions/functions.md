## Functions:

### 1) Describe what a function is called before it is defined.

```
One can call a function before it is defined, this is called hoisting. (A function defined with expression syntax or ES6 arrow function will be assigned to a variable, and any variable used before it is defined will have the value of 'undefined'.)

When a javascript file is executed, the JS interpreter reads through the whole file top to bottom, assigning values and figuring out what needs to be run when. Function declarations are then ‘hoisted’ or lifted to the top of the file, essentially reordering them. This is not what happens behind the scenes but it makes it easier to think about this way.
