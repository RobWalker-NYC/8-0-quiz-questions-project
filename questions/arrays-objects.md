## Arrays & Objects:

### 1) What is a multidimensional array ?

```
Multidimensional arrays are arrays that contain arrays as their elements. If an array is filled with arrays it is considered to be 2 dimensional (also often referred to as a matrix). If those arrays are also filled with arrays it becomes a 3 dimensional array or multidimensional. Typically it is badÂ practice to go further than 2 dimensional arrays.
