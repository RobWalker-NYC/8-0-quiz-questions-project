## GitHub:

### 1) What is the difference between git versus GitHub and if either is owned, who owns it ?

```
The difference is, git is a technology, a Version Control System (VCS) that lets you manage and keep track of one's source code history, GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service company that stores your git repositories. Microsoft purchased GitHub in 2016.
