## git:


### 1) What does the CLI acronym stand for and what does the terminal do?

```
CLI stands for Command Line Interface , is a command line program that accepts text input to execute operating system functions, only in the computer terminal instead of graphical user interface (GUI) with a mouse.

The terminal is the actual interface to the console that one can type and execute text based commands.
